The notebooks contain the code to generate the pictures used in the [paper](),
these can additionally be found in the `images/` folder. The `integators` folder
contains the implementations of all the algorithms tested. The notebooks can
be run remotely via binder, clocking on the badge above, or locally by using
`jupyter`, a recent version of `python`, `numpy` and `matplotlib` is required 
(see `requirements.txt` for a compatible set of dependencies).

The available notebooks, containing the code to generate the pictures in the paper, are:

- `The Time-Perturbed Kepler Problem.ipynb`;

- `Contact Oscillator.ipynb`
